  notes:
    - ~~Link using html encoding which parses to an invite in the viewing client.~~
    - The linked server usually features a support ticket bot and can be used for different followup scams (like crypto wallet draining, demanding payment, threats and account takeovers)
  deprecation: Discord has changed the parsing engine and no longer accepts %-encoding in links, meaning they are not resolved and not clickable.

  name: crypto giveaway
  detection:
    - type: regex
      pattern: (?:(?:[1-5]|image)\.(?:jpg|png)[\s\S]*){3,}
      explanation: Naming images 1/2/3/4/5.png or image.png is very uncommon. False positives may still happen in messages with image links, where the image hash ends with 1/2/3/4/5.
  notes:
    - A message (often just with images) showing faked news articles about crypto casino giveaways, early mints or similar as well as faked proof of receiving credit in a crypto wallet.
    - Variants with different stories and influencers as well as different looks for the fake casino exist.

    - Hello I want to give out my Southeast Technical institute MacBook 2020 & Charger** for free, it's in perfect health and good as new, alongside a charger so it's perfect, I want to give it out because I just got a new model from my uncle as a brithday present and I thought of giving out the old one go someone who can't afford one and is in need of it...Strictly First come first serve ! DM IF YUOU ARE INTERESTED
    - Hello everyone, I'm writing to offer my old Apple 2021 MacBook Pro 16-inch M1 and its charger for free. The device is in excellent condition and is practically new. I'm giving it away because I recently received a new model and thought it would be a great help to someone who might not be able to afford a new device. Please note that this offer is on a first-come, first-served basis. If you're interested, please send me a direct message.
  notes:
    - Message of someone claiming to give away an older MacBook because they got a new model and want to give it to someone unable to afford their own device.
    - Often comes with an attached image of a MacBook in a box or ready to be shipped
    - This will usually result in the scammer asking for up-front payment for shipping and import fees. After paying the victim is ghosted
    - For some reason, scammers are very explicit about giving away the Macbook +/&/and/with charger

  notes:
    - A message promising steam credit for simply logging in through the link. This scam will result in a steam account takeover.
    - Steam community look-alikes are usually hidden behind a link shortener (u.to, e.vg, etc.).
    - In some variants the scammers claim to be or speak in the name of a steam co-founder, Gabe Newell.
  detection:
    - type: regex
      pattern: \[.*steamcommunity.com.*\]\(.*\)
      explanation: There is no reason why someone would use steamcommunity.com in the mask `[]` rather than the link `()` part, unless they are trying to mask malicious intent.
    - type: regex
      pattern: ([0-9oO]{2}[\$€] gift)|(gift [0-9oO]{2,}[\$€])
      explanation: Focusing on the "50$" part of the message. Thread actors have started to replace the value of numbers with look-alike characters. This may still come in handy for those few scams not using masked links. Scammers stick to 50$ as the gift value pretty consistently.

  notes:
    - Scammers claim to be looking for someone with a US/EU upwork account to share revenue with. Scammers then use the shared account to commit fraud in the name of the victim.
    - This can result in major legal trouble. Upwork and similar platform accounts should never be shared.

  name: wrong slash
  notes:
    - Discord renders invites although they use the wrong slash (`discord.com/invite\abdcdef` instead of `discord.com/invite/abcdef`)
    - This may be used by spammers and scammers to bypass simple invite patterns and spread all sorts of scam servers.
  detection:
    - type: automod
      pattern: '*invite\*'
      explanation: Nobody legitimate uses the wrong slash when posting invites. If used, at least the intent of bypassing filters can be assumed.

  name: bookmarklet
  notes:
    - The victim is asked to drag a button/link into their bookmarks and click on it when visiting discord/steam/legitimate page. Doing so executes embedded scripts and will usually result in account takeover.
    - 'This scam uses [bookmarklets](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet>), bookmarks with embedded javascript.'
    - On inspection, the link will be very long and look very suspicious with URL encoded embedded scripts.

  name: accidental report
  notes:
    - Victim is made to believe that their account was accidentally reported and told to reach out to a scammer impersonating support staff to resolve the issue. If followed, this will usually result in account takeover by convincing the victim to change their email address associated to the account to a scammer-controlled address.
    - Variants exist where scammers ask for payment to resolve the report instead
    - The scam is often accompanied by faked screenshots of reports, emails, certificates (built from information obtained from employee linkedin profiles)
    - Steam or other service variants are less common but also possible

      type: automod
      explanation: Tradingview Premium is the most common target for this scam. In most communities not centered around investment, blocking this should have minimal impact on day-to-day conversations.
  notes:
    - Scammer posts a link to an external source (usually reddit) including download links and fake feedback/support conversations. The download includes [RAT](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_desktop_software#RAT>)s or info stealers.
    - This scam usually targets crypto and trading software impersonation.

  name: help to earn
  notes:
    - Scammer promises to help the victim earn large amounts of money in a short timeframe for taking a low cut. Usually this will result in the scammer asking the victim to transfer money into some account they have agency over and the scammer eventually withdrawing the money and ghosting the victim.
    - Usually tries to lure the victim to a direct message on a more anonymous service like telegram
