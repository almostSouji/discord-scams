  notes:
    - ~~Link using html encoding which parses to an invite in the viewing client.~~
    - The linked server usually features a support ticket bot and can be used for different followup scams (like crypto wallet draining, demanding payment, threats and account takeovers)
  deprecation: Discord has changed the parsing engine and no longer accepts %-encoding in links, meaning they are not resolved and not clickable.

  name: crypto giveaway
  detection:
    - type: regex
      pattern: (?:(?:[1-5]|image)\.(?:jpg|png)[\s\S]*){3,}
      explanation: Naming images 1/2/3/4/5.png or image.png is very uncommon. False positives may still happen in messages with image links, where the image hash ends with 1/2/3/4/5.
  notes:
    - A message (often just with images) showing faked news articles about crypto casino giveaways, early mints or similar as well as faked proof of receiving credit in a crypto wallet.
    - Variants with different stories and influencers as well as different looks for the fake casino exist.

    - Hello I want to give out my Southeast Technical institute MacBook 2020 & Charger** for free, it's in perfect health and good as new, alongside a charger so it's perfect, I want to give it out because I just got a new model from my uncle as a brithday present and I thought of giving out the old one go someone who can't afford one and is in need of it...Strictly First come first serve ! DM IF YUOU ARE INTERESTED
    - Hello everyone, I'm writing to offer my old Apple 2021 MacBook Pro 16-inch M1 and its charger for free. The device is in excellent condition and is practically new. I'm giving it away because I recently received a new model and thought it would be a great help to someone who might not be able to afford a new device. Please note that this offer is on a first-come, first-served basis. If you're interested, please send me a direct message.
  notes:
    - Message of someone claiming to give away an older MacBook because they got a new model and want to give it to someone unable to afford their own device.
    - Often comes with an attached image of a MacBook in a box or ready to be shipped
    - This will usually result in the scammer asking for up-front payment for shipping and import fees. After paying the victim is ghosted
    - For some reason, scammers are very explicit about giving away the Macbook +/&/and/with charger

    - Invite to a NSFW community. The linked server has a fake verification flow including a visual clone of a reputable app which will lead to discord account takeover if followed.
    - Some of these servers tend to have vanity links.

  notes:
    - A message promising steam credit for simply logging in through the link. This scam will result in a steam account takeover.
    - Steam community look-alikes are usually hidden behind a link shortener (u.to, e.vg, etc.).
    - In some variants the scammers claim to be or speak in the name of a steam co-founder, Gabe Newell.
  detection:
    - type: regex
      pattern: \[.*steamcommunity.com.*\]\(.*\)
      explanation: There is no reason why someone would use steamcommunity.com in the mask `[]` rather than the link `()` part, unless they are trying to mask malicious intent.
    - type: regex
      pattern: ([0-9oO]{2}[\$€] gift)|(gift [0-9oO]{2,}[\$€])
      explanation: Focusing on the "50$" part of the message. Thread actors have started to replace the value of numbers with look-alike characters. This may still come in handy for those few scams not using masked links. Scammers stick to 50$ as the gift value pretty consistently.

  notes:
    - Scammers claim to be looking for someone with a US/EU upwork account to share revenue with. Scammers then use the shared account to commit fraud in the name of the victim.
    - This can result in major legal trouble. Upwork and similar platform accounts should never be shared.

  name: wrong slash
  notes:
    - Discord renders invites although they use the wrong slash (`discord.com/invite\abdcdef` instead of `discord.com/invite/abcdef`)
    - This may be used by spammers and scammers to bypass simple invite patterns and spread all sorts of scam servers.
  detection:
    - type: automod
      pattern: '*invite\*'
      explanation: Nobody legitimate uses the wrong slash when posting invites. If used, at least the intent of bypassing filters can be assumed.

  name: bookmarklet
  notes:
    - The victim is asked to drag a button/link into their bookmarks and click on it when visiting discord/steam/legitimate page. Doing so executes embedded scripts and will usually result in account takeover.
    - 'This scam uses [bookmarklets](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet>), bookmarks with embedded javascript.'
    - On inspection, the link will be very long and look very suspicious with URL encoded embedded scripts.
